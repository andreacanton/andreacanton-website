I just tried to create a simple writing text animation using css and vanilla javascript.

The text indicator is pure css using `@keyframes` in loop. The writing effect is done by using a `setInterval`.

An improovement that it came to my mind is to change the _interval_ every time and increment to one second if I encounter a period.

Do you think I can do better?
