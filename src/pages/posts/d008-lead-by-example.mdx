title: Lead by Example, Not by Lecturing

description: We all have that colleague who drives us crazy, but what if the solution isn't trying to change them? This post explores a simple but powerful approach, instead of judging others or trying to teach them through words, focus on your own behavior and lead by example. From picking up trash without lecturing to organizing yourself when work feels chaotic, small actions often create more change than big speeches. Because here's the truth - you might be someone's annoying colleague too, but at least you can control your own reactions

Do you have a colleague who continues making the same mistakes, or even worse: do you have a colleague who annoys you every time he or she speaks or is even present in the same room?

Have you ever asked yourself how you can deal with these kinds of situations?

I have, and here are my thoughts about it.

First of all, I think you should try to find something good in her or him, and focus on that.

You should also remember that he or she has to deal with your defects too.

More generally, I think you should stop blaming other people when something is not right for you or when "human interaction" is difficult.

Stop judging other people and judge yourself.

Stop talking to teach others how to live their life and start acting to live your life better.

If at work there is no organization: start organizing yourself.

If the code of the product sucks: start writing tests and refactor it.

Let's change environment. If someone throws trash on the street, pick it up and put it in the bin and wash your hands (or use a napkin or something to pick it up). Don't say anything, don't blame anyone. Just act.

By honking at someone who cut you off, it won't teach him/her anything. Just try to be respectful when you drive. Start early so you will not be in a rush.

If you want to teach people something, you should do it by showing what you think is right, not by saying it.

First, you can't always be sure that what you do is always good. By doing "the thing" yourself, maybe you'll learn that you are wrong.

Second, other people are different from you. What is good for you is not good for them.

Lastly, you should focus on how you behave rather than judge other people.

**In other words, you should focus on becoming a better citizen, becoming part of the change and trying to teach other people by doing it.**

At this point you could say: «Wait a minute! This dude is teaching me by telling me how to behave!» And you are right. Indeed, by reading this article it is not guaranteed that you'll become a better person. Also because I could be wrong.

I don't want you to feel wrong if you let out some anger or frustration with a colleague about the disorganization of your team. And I know what a relief it feels like to honk at someone when you are right (you are always right, aren't you?).

But cultivating anger can drain your [energy](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/d007-energy-time/) instead of using it in a more productive way.

In the last few years, when someone is tailgating me I stopped doing a "brake test." Instead, I try to find a spot to park or do an extra spin in the next roundabout to let the person behind me pass. I also try always to start early so I would not be in a rush. Results? I feel less stressed when I drive and my fuel consumption is lower.

I've tried to apply this principle to other aspects of my life, and even if my code doesn't have the best test coverage or my organization is not perfect, I feel less stressed and I work better—and maybe my colleagues work better with me.

Who knows? Maybe I'm that annoying colleague for someone else. But at least I'm trying to focus on [what I can control](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/d006-you-are-culture/): my own behavior and reactions.
