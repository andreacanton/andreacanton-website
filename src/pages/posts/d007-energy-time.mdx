«Time is money» they say, maybe not every-*time*.
I'm recently thinking about this concept that maybe we are all wrong choosing time and time only to plan, maybe energy can be a better way to decide how we spend our days.

My therapist in a down period of my life said to me «Time doesn't heal wounds, is what you do in that time that heals». Whatching TV shows or playing videogames it disctract me from my current situation, it doesn't change my situation, time pass but is not filled with meaningful actions.

Scrolling your prefered social media platform what's add to your life? You are constantly draining your energy for something that it doesn't give you very little in return.

Being intentional on how you spend your energy and how you can re-charge.

Recharging your energy is as important that using it, but how?

The first thing that maybe came up in your mind is sleeping, and you surely know that you have to sleep at least 7 hours every night, better 8 hours.

Spending time to recharge your energy doesn't have to mean that you have to do nothing. Changing your routine, doing something different can be recharging. After a day of hiking you can feel tired, but in a way you feel refreshed.

Hobbies helps recharge your mind energies: play some instrument, paint, woodworking, writing if is not for your job it recharge your metal batteries.

For me and my wife even working on our expences excel is refreshing...I mean, Excel! Is all about the purpose and the mindset. Is not work, is doing something different.

For three years I've partecipated to a local charity to deliver food to people in needs in my town. I went every thursday night from 7PM throught midnight, it appeared very stressful from outside, but the next day I was rady to go to work with my minds refreshed.

(Note: After three years it became like a job and I wasn't enable to help a lot, so I've decided to take a break, I will restart after "cooling down".)

As always, I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, this is only a thought from my mind and I'm hoping that can start a conversation.
