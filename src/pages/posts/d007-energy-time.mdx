«Time is money» they say, maybe not every-*time*.
I'm recently thinking about this concept that maybe we are all wrong choosing time and time only to plan, maybe energy can be a better way to decide how we spend our days.

My therapist in a down period of my life said to me «Time doesn't heal wounds, is what you do in that time that heals». Whatching TV shows or playing videogames it disctract me from my current situation, it doesn't change my situation, time pass but is not filled with meaningful actions.

Watching TV shows drain your energy
