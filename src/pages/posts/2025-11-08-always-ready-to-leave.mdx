subtitle: The professional habits that made my departure smooth are the same ones that made my work better every day.
---

Next week I start a new job. After seven years at Terranova, I'm joining a new company in a similar role as a senior software engineer.

When I told my supervisor, he wasn't surprised. I'd been talking openly about my struggles for over a year—lack of motivation, missing promotion, compensation not matching my contributions.

My peers were caught off guard. They knew I was frustrated sometimes, but I hadn't been ranting to them constantly. That was intentional.

By the time I had the exit interview with HR, it was a formality. When they asked "Is there something we can do to change your mind?" I answered: "You already tried everything. We've already talked."

The conversation was over. We just discussed notice periods and bureaucracy.

Here's what surprised me: the practices that made my exit smooth weren't "exit strategies." They were professional habits I should have built years earlier—habits that made work better even when I was staying.

## Talk to Decision-Makers, Not Just Colleagues

For a year before leaving, I talked openly with my supervisor and HR about my dissatisfaction. Not ranting. Not threatening. Just honest communication about what wasn't working.

Ranting with colleagues feels cathartic, but it changes nothing. It drains [your energy](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-05-27-energy-time/) and creates negativity without solutions.

Talking to people who can actually change things? That's professional problem-solving.

Even if nothing changed at Terranova, I built a relationship based on transparency. They knew where I stood. I gave them opportunities to address issues. When I finally left, there was no drama, no burned bridges.

**This isn't just for leaving.** It's [leading by example](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-08-17-lead-by-example/). Instead of complaining about problems, you address them directly with people who have power to fix them.

## Document Like You're Going on Holiday

In my last two weeks, I kept telling colleagues: "Let's play the game of 'Andrea is gone' with Andrea still present."

I'd already documented everything. The game was about learning to use that documentation instead of just asking me. They needed to practice finding answers while I could still help if they got stuck.

But documentation isn't an exit strategy. It's a practice that makes your life easier every day.

When you write things down:
- You clarify your own thinking
- You reduce cognitive load—you're not the single point of failure
- You can actually take holidays without anxiety
- New team members onboard faster
- You look more professional, not less

Yes, good documentation makes you "replaceable." But that's freedom, not weakness. When the system doesn't depend on you remembering everything, you can focus on higher-value work.

The best time to document isn't two weeks before leaving. It's right now.

## Choose Your Battles Strategically

"Never back down" sounds like you should fight every battle. But professional growth requires the opposite: strategic choices about where to invest [your energy](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-05-27-energy-time/).

I learned to ask: **Which responsibilities build my professional skills? Which ones trap me in work that doesn't grow my career?**

Some battles are worth fighting. Others drain you without advancing your goals.

This isn't about being lazy or avoiding hard work. It's about investing your finite energy where it compounds—learning new technologies, solving complex problems, building relationships.

When you manage responsibilities strategically, you either grow into better opportunities at your current company, or you build skills that make you attractive elsewhere.

## The Paradox: Being Ready to Leave Made Leaving Less Necessary

Here's the strange thing: practicing these habits—communicating clearly, documenting well, managing energy strategically—actually improved my work situation.

When I documented processes, I felt less stressed. When I communicated issues, some got addressed (not all, but some). When I chose battles carefully, I had energy for meaningful work.

Being "ready to leave" doesn't mean you're checked out. It means you're working professionally regardless of how long you stay.

The irony? If I'd built these habits earlier, I might have been happier at Terranova. Or I might have left sooner. Either way, I would have been making conscious choices instead of feeling trapped.

## Never Burn Bridges

When you finally do leave, these habits make the transition clean.

**Know the law.** Understand your notice period, your rights, your obligations.

**Follow the hierarchy.** Your supervisor should hear first, then HR, then your peers. Don't gossip about your departure before it's official.

**Stay useful until the last day.** But "useful" means helping your team work without you, not taking on new responsibilities. Finish what you can. Transfer knowledge. Make the transition smooth.

**Be genuinely grateful.** Seven years taught me a lot. The people were mostly great. The work had value. Even when things weren't perfect, there were real relationships and real growth.

Leaving well isn't about being fake or political. It's about [acting with integrity](https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-08-17-lead-by-example/) until the end.

## Starting Fresh (With the Same Habits)

Next week I join a new company. I'll be the new person again after being established for seven years. It's humbling and exciting.

But I'm bringing these habits with me from day one:
- I'll document as I learn
- I'll communicate openly with my new supervisor
- I'll choose responsibilities that build my skills
- I'll work like I might stay forever, and like I might leave tomorrow

Because these aren't "exit strategies." They're how professionals work, whether they're staying for one year or ten.

## The Real Lesson

The best way to leave well is to work well every day.

Don't wait until you have another offer to communicate what's not working. Don't wait until your last week to document what you know. Don't wait until you're burned out to manage your energy strategically.

Build the habits now. Whether you stay or leave, you'll be better off.

And if you do leave someday? Nobody will be surprised. The conversation will already be over. You'll just discuss notice periods and bureaucracy.

_As always, these are my thoughts from my experience. Your situation is different. But maybe something here resonates with where you are now._
