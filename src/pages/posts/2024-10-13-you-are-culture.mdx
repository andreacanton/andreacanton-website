This is my personal thinking about influencing the culture you are living in. I'm writing for me, but I hope it can be useful for you too.

### The temptation to blame others

If you are working or living in a toxic environment, of course, you can rant about it. Of course, you can think about what other people can do to improve the situation.

It's perfectly normal to have and express those things called emotions. But here's the thing: you are part of that environment too.

So instead of focusing only on what others should do, ask yourself: what can YOU do to improve the situation?

### A workplace example

Scenario: you are in a team where it's usual to do overtime every day.

- Your rant: IT CAN'T BE NORMAL TO DO OVERTIME EVERY DAY!
- Your analysis: People shouldn't stay overtime and should protest
- Your action: try not to stay overtime

This might seem small, but you're contributing to the mean value of the quality of your environment. Every person who chooses not to normalize unhealthy practices shifts the culture, even slightly.

### It works everywhere - even in politics

The same principle applies beyond your workplace. Think about your country's government. The possibility that you're not happy with what politicians do is very high, but in a democracy, they represent the people.

Here's an uncomfortable truth: politicians reflect the collective values and choices of their voters. I'm not blaming anyone, but you are part of "the people." However small your influence, you're responsible for that part of the collective behavior.

Elections are often won by tiny percentages. Every individual vote and voice matters.

### Your impact is bigger than you think

Now think about the company where you work. Even if it's FAANG or some massive corporation, you can have an impact. Even if you're the junior receptionist (big shout out to all junior receptionists who read my blog!).

You influence your environment even when you think you're doing nothing. Your attitude, your standards, your small daily choices - they all contribute to the cultural average.

### What you can do

In a nutshell, here's my suggestion:

1. Be respectful, because you can be wrong.
2. Be patient, because you don't have everything under control.
3. Ask, listen and then act.
4. Think about what you can do to change the situation.

### The bottom line

You're not powerless. You're not just a victim of your environment - you're an active participant in creating it. Every day, through small actions and choices, you're either raising or lowering the cultural bar around you.

The question isn't whether you have influence. The question is: what are you going to do with it?
